## 📘 Notes & Reflections
- ✅ Markdown strategy is working well for modular updates across technical and academic files
- 📈 Python milestones may benefit from a visual timeline or chart output — consider integrating `matplotlib` or `Plotly`
- 🔒 Security scans complete; next step is VPN + SSL config validation
