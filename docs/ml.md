## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This page introduces the foundations of Machine Learning in a clear and friendly way.  
It builds on the AI page and goes deeper into learning algorithms, workflows, and examples.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Topics to Cover (in stages)

- What is Machine Learning?
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Key Algorithms (Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM)
- Data Preparation: Cleaning, Scaling, Encoding
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Model Deployment Basics (just an intro)

---

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Understand how machines use data to make predictions
- Recognize the stages of building an ML pipeline
- Explore different algorithm types and their use cases

---

## ðŸ”„ Future Links

This page will eventually link to:
- `/ai` â†’ High-level AI overview
- `/tools` â†’ Python and ML libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.)
- `/blog` â†’ Case studies of ML in action
- `/tracker` â†’ Visual dashboard showing model performance

## ðŸ“˜ Notes

This Markdown file will become the basis for `ml.html`, rendered via Flask using:

```python
@app.route("/ml")
def ml_page():
    return render_template("ml.html")
