## 🧩 Example 1: Tracking AI Learning Time

### ⏱️ Scenario  
You log hours spent on various AI/ML topics and want to visualize progress week by week.

### 📊 How Matplotlib Helps  
- Plots line graphs of time vs topic  
- Adds annotations for breakthrough sessions  
- Highlights gaps in learning using styled regions  
- Embeds directly into Flask dashboard for live reflection

### 📈 Result  
The chart reveals productivity trends, plateaus, and boosts motivation by showing visible growth.

## 🧩 Example 2: Model Accuracy Comparison

### 🤖 Scenario  
You train multiple ML classifiers on the same dataset and want to compare their accuracy.

### 📊 How Matplotlib Helps  
- Renders grouped bar charts for `LogisticRegression`, `SVM`, `RandomForest`, etc.  
- Adds error bars for cross-validation scores  
- Styles results with color codes for clarity

### 📈 Result  
You instantly see which models performed best — without digging into tables or raw logs.
