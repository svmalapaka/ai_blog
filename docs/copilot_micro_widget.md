# 💬 Building a Copilot-Style Widget for Your AI Lab

---

## 📌 Purpose

This widget lets visitors engage with a floating AI assistant — like a mini Copilot in your blog corner.  
It offers tips, summaries, or guided navigation based on what page the user is on.

## 🧩 Example 1: Floating Box with Input + Response

### 🧠 Scenario  
On every tool story page, you want a small helper box that can answer questions like "What does NumPy do?" or "Summarize the Flask section."

### 🛠️ Frontend Setup  

```html
<!-- Fixed-position AI Assistant Widget -->
<div id="copilot-widget">
  <textarea id="user-input" placeholder="Ask me anything..."></textarea>
  <button onclick="sendMessage()">▶</button>
  <div id="copilot-response"></div>
</div>
