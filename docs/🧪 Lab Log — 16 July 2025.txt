## 🧪 Lab Log — 16 July 2025

### 🎯 Goals
- Resolve persistent 404 on `/tool-viewer/pandas_basics`
- Build and deploy an accessible `/about` route
- Verify GitHub sync status across Windows and Linux environments
- Clean up repo structure and `.gitignore`

---

### 🧠 Activities

- Debugged `tool_viewer()` route using raw Markdown display
- Identified multiple `app = Flask(__name__)` declarations causing route collisions
- Resolved `AssertionError` due to duplicate function names
- Built a custom `/about` page with personalized narrative
- Verified and committed all changes via Git on Windows
- Cleaned `.gitignore` to exclude `venv/`, logs, backup markdowns, and IDE clutter
- Pushed a comprehensive commit to GitHub with status confirmation

---

### ✅ Outcomes

- Lab is fully synced with GitHub (`svmalapaka/ai_blog`)
- `docs/tools_stories` now includes: `about.md`, `pandas_basics.md`, `lab-log-2025-07-14.md`
- Route `/about` live and styled
- Markdown tutorials successfully rendered via `/tool-viewer/<name>`
- Development environment now clean, versioned, and multi-platform stable

### 💬 Notes

> “One extra line wiped routes, one debug print revealed the truth. Today wasn’t just about fixing Flask — it was about seeing the system clearly. This lab now runs with clarity and purpose.”
