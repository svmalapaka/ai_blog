  <h1>About the Lab</h1>
  <p>Welcome! I'm Sastry â€” building a secure, scalable lab environment where mathematics, automation, and system design converge. This portal continues the journey I began as a Windows Administrator, now focused on applying AI, ML, and Python-powered automation in real-world contexts.</p>

  <h2>Current Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Resolve technical issues related to Flask bindings and Cloudflare tunnels to successfully launch the lab portal.</li>
    <li>Finalize lab documentation and security configurations before relaunching.</li>
    <li>Restart the lab site after completing all upgrades and documentation tasks.</li>
  </ul>
